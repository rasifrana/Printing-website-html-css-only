				<p>Our spinning trainers create a fun and energetic atmosphere in every spinning class. They will guide you through each
					stage of the workout, motivating you at all times. Spinning is about keeping your muscles working at all times. You’ll
					move through different levels of intensity, and types of techniques, such as climbing, standing, and sprinting.</p>

				<p>Our bikes are designed to help you gain maximum impact from every class. These top quality bikes feel like real road
					bikes, have comfortable, adjustable seats, and can measure your progress during each class. They monitor calories burned,
					distance, and heart rate. Even the most enthusiastic spinner will find plenty of classes at Ger Conroy Fitness. We have
					20 classes per month. Classes are scheduled at different times of the day, so no matter how hectic your schedule, you’ll
					be able to get your spinning class fix. You can choose a 1-class, drop-in pass, or set yourself up for total spinning
					success with an unlimited monthly spinning class pass.</p>
